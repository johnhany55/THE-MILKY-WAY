            <p>The Dundee meteorite (367943) coincided with the Earth The fall of the Chelyabinsk meteorite happened by chance about 20 hours before the large meteor (367943) Duende passed at the closest distance to Earth. The Dundee meteorite has a diameter twice as large as the Chelyabinsk meteorite, and its mass is estimated at 130,000 tons.</p>

            <p>Solar system meteorites, meteors in the sky (maybe two meteors!) and the background of the Milky Way. The current official definition of the term meteorite by the International Astronomical Union states that it is a solid body floating in space between other planets, and its size may be considerably smaller than that of an asteroid (about 250 meters in diameter) but it is also greatly larger than the size of an atom.</p>
